# Adaptive-Grover-Algorithm for Weighted data search
This project implements adaptive-grover-algorithm using Qiskit, analyzing differet dataset distributions and producing visualization results.
Special thanks to Yifan Sun and Lian-Ao Wu for [Quantum search algorithm on weighted databases](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-81701-7), which has been a helpful reference.
