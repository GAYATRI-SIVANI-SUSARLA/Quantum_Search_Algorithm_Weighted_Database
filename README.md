# Adaptive-Grover-Algorithm for Weighted data search
- This project implements an Adaptive-Grover-Algorithm using Qiskit, analyzing different dataset
   distributions and producing visualization results.

## Abstract 
- The Adaptive Grover Algorithm is designed for weighted data search problems, it is
   essential for quantum subroutines in various complex algorithms.
- Our analysis and implementation reveal the adaptive quantum search nature compared to linear 
    search.
- We addressed the key challenges in designing an adaptive Grover search compared it with the 
   original Grover Algorithm, and explained about results for distributions in real-world weighted 
   data. In conclusion, our project provides a few enhancements to the original Groverâ€™s search 
   implementation strategies and scalability of the algorithm.
